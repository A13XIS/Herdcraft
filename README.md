This is a continuation of Nakranoth's HerdCraft modification for Minecraft.

HerdCraft adds no blocks, items or mobs to the game, but makes the game more interesting:

- Horses, cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, skeletons, or zombies try to stick together in homogenous groups(herds).
- Entire herds of horses, cows, or sheep will stampede when any is injured.
- Entire hersd will collectively follow players with food.
- Entire herds will slowly procreate to increase their numbers.
- Pigs and chickens do more or less the same, but are much less organized.
- If one zombie spots you, the whole horde pursues.
- Rarely whole hordes of zombies will spawn.
- When a clack of skeletons spots you, it will form firing lines.
